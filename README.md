# ðŸ‘¤ ðŸ—‘ User retention

Users are deleted when they did not log into their account within the given number of days. This will also delete all files of the affected users.

**Please note:** Having the sync client running in the background does not refresh your last login time. So only explicit logins on the web interface prevent the users from being deleted.
